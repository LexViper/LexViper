# Hi there, I'm Abhay üëã  

### üöÄ About Me  
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on cool ML projects while sharpening my DSA skills.  
- üå± I‚Äôm into developing AI solutions that make life easier, even if I‚Äôm still figuring out what they'll do ‚Äî one step at a time!  
- üí° My approach to projects? I build a solid roadmap before diving in, like I did with Image Generation, Video Anomaly Detection, and Deepfake Analysis. Planning first, building next, and perfecting it with practice!  
- üí¨ Ask me about Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, MySQL, APIs, or anything ML and DSA related.  
- ü§î Fun Fact: I‚Äôm always up for a challenge, whether it's coding from scratch or exploring new AI concepts.  
- ‚ö° Hobby: When I‚Äôm not coding, you might find me tinkering with tech or binge-watching sci-fi movies.
