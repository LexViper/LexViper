# Hi there, I'm Abhay 👋  

### 🚀 About Me  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on cool ML projects while sharpening my DSA skills.  
- 🌱 I’m into developing AI solutions that make life easier, even if I’m still figuring out what they'll do — one step at a time!  
- 💡 My approach to projects? I build a solid roadmap before diving in, like I did with Image Generation, Video Anomaly Detection, and Deepfake Analysis. Planning first, building next, and perfecting it with practice!  
- 💬 Ask me about Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, MySQL, APIs, or anything ML and DSA related.  
- 🤔 Fun Fact: I’m always up for a challenge, whether it's coding from scratch or exploring new AI concepts.
