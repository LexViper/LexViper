# Hey, I’m Abhay! 👋  
*Coding AI dreams and chasing algorithms*

### 🧑‍💻 About Me  
- 🔬 **ML Junkie**: Building cool stuff like deepfake detectors and video anomaly spotters.  
- 🧠 **DSA Grinder**: Sharpening my skills with Python, Java, and C++ one puzzle at a time.  
- 🗺️ **Plan-First Coder**: I sketch a roadmap before diving into projects—think Image Gen or chatbots.  
- 🎬 **Off-Screen**: Bingeing sci-fi movies or tinkering with tech when I’m not coding.  
- 💡 **Fun Fact**: I’d code a neural net to pick the perfect sci-fi flick if I could!

### 🚀 Top Projects  
- **Story Weaver Chatbot**  
  A Flask app that crafts choose-your-own-adventure stories with DistilGPT-2.  
  *Impact*: Deployed a demo that got 50+ users hooked in a week!  
  [GitHub](https://github.com/LexViper/story-weaver)  

- **Video Anomaly Detection**  
  Spots odd patterns in videos using Random Forest and OpenCV—smart cams, anyone?  
  *Impact*: Achieved 92% accuracy on test datasets.  
  [GitHub](https://github.com/LexViper/video-anomaly-detection)  

- **Deepfake Analysis**  
  Detects fake videos with scikit-learn and CNNs. My fight against digital trickery!  
  *Impact*: Presented at a local ML meetup.  
  [GitHub](https://github.com/LexViper/deepfake-analysis)

### 🌱 Currently Exploring  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training agents to play games smarter than me (tough challenge 😜).  
- **Generative AI**: Experimenting with GANs for creative tools like art or music.  
- **LeetCode**: Aiming for 100+ DSA problems solved by year-end.

### 🔮 What’s Next?  
I’m chasing big ideas—think AI that learns like a human or apps that make life 10x easier. Next up: building an RL-powered game bot and maybe crashing a hackathon or two. Stay tuned! 🚀
